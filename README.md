# Weather-Forecasting
The aim is to forecasting weather using decision tree classification that offers a data-driven approach to predicting weather conditions by leveraging historical data and feature relationships.

The project focused on utilizing decision tree classification for weather forecasting, aiming to predict changes in current atmospheric conditions. By leveraging this approach, the project provided valuable weather forecasts that enabled children to make informed decisions about outdoor activities. 

This initiative aimed to enhance children's leisure experiences by helping them choose the optimal times and places for their outdoor pursuits based on accurate weather predictions. The decision tree model, developed and implemented as part of the project, achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 80%, further demonstrating its effectiveness in making reliable weather forecasts for improved planning and enjoyment.
